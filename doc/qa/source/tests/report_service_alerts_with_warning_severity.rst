Expected Result
:::::::::::::::

The Grafana UI shows that the global service status goes from ok to warning and
back to ok. It also reports detailed information about which entity is missing.

The Nagios UI shows that the service status goes from ok to warning and back to
ok. Alerts are sent by email to the configured recipient.
