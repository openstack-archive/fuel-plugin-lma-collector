* ``read_prev`` for the requests that read the previous row in key order.
* ``read_rnd`` for the requests that read a row based on a fixed position.
* ``read_rnd_next`` for the requests that read the next row in the data file.
* ``rollback`` the requests that perform rollback operation.
* ``update`` the requests that update a row in a table.
* ``write`` the requests that insert a row in a table.

Locks

for further details.

* ``mysql_cluster_size``, current number of nodes in the cluster.
* ``mysql_cluster_status``, ``1`` when the node is 'Primary', ``2`` if 'Non-Primary' and ``3`` if 'Disconnected'.
* ``mysql_cluster_connected``, ``1`` when the node is connected to the cluster, ``0`` otherwise.
* ``mysql_cluster_ready``, ``1`` when the node is ready to accept queries, ``0`` otherwise.
* ``mysql_cluster_local_commits``, number of writesets commited on the node.
* ``mysql_cluster_received_bytes``, total size in bytes of writesets received from other nodes.
* ``mysql_cluster_received``, total number of writesets received from other nodes.
* ``mysql_cluster_replicated_bytes`` total size in bytes of writesets sent to other nodes.
* ``mysql_cluster_replicated``, total number of writesets sent to other nodes.
* ``mysql_cluster_local_cert_failures``, number of writesets that failed the certification test.
* ``mysql_cluster_local_send_queue``, the number of writesets waiting to be sent.
* ``mysql_cluster_local_recv_queue``, the number of writesets waiting to be applied.
