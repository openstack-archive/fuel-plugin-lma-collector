Version 0.10.0
++++++++++++++

Additionally to the bug fixes, the StackLight Collector plugin 0.10.0 for Fuel
contains the following updates:

* Separated the processing pipeline for logs and metrics.

  Prior to StackLight version 0.10.0, there was one instance of the *hekad*
  process running to process both the logs and the metrics. Starting with
  StackLight version 0.10.0, the processing of the logs and notifications is
  separated from the processing of the metrics in two different *hekad*
  instances. This allows for better performance and control of the flow when
  the maximum buffer size on disk has reached a limit. With the *hekad*
  instance processing the metrics, the buffering policy mandates to drop the
  metrics when the maximum buffer size is reached. With the *hekad* instance
  processing the logs, the buffering policy mandates to block the entire
  processing pipeline. This helps to avoid losing logs (and notifications)
  when the Elasticsearch server is inaccessible for a long period of time.
  As a result, the StackLight collector has now two processes running
  on the node:

  * One for the *log_collector* service
  * One for the *metric_collector* service

* The metrics derived from logs are now aggregated by the *log_collector*
  service.

  To avoid flooding the *metric_collector* with bursts of metrics derived from
  logs, the *log_collector* service sends metrics by bulk to the
  *metric_collector* service. An example of aggregated metric derived from
  logs is the `openstack_<service>_http_response_time_stats
  <http://fuel-plugin-lma-collector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix_b.html#api-response-times>`_.

* Added a diagnostic tool.

  A diagnostic tool is now available to help diagnose issues. The diagnostic
  tool checks that the toolchain is properly installed and configured across
  the entire LMA toolchain. For more information, see
  :ref:`Diagnostic tool <diagnostic>`.

Version 0.9.0
+++++++++++++

The StackLight Collector plugin 0.9.0 for Fuel contains the following updates:

    See `#1503251 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/lma-toolchain/+bug/1503251>`_.

  * Enabled buffering for Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, Nagios and TCP outputs to
