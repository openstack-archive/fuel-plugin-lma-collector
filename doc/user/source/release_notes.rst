Release notes
-------------

Version 0.10.0
++++++++++++++

* Changes

  * Separate processing pipeline for logs and metrics

    Prior to StackLight version 0.10.0, there was one instance of the *hekad*
    process running to process both the logs and the metrics. Starting with StackLight
    version 0.10.0, the processing of the logs and notifications is separated
    from the processing of the metrics in two different *hekad* instances.
    This allows for better performance and control of the flow when the
    maximum buffer size on disk has reached a limit. With the *hekad* instance
    processing the metrics, the buffering policy mandates to drop the metrics
    when the maximum buffer size is reached. With the *hekad* instance
    processing the logs, the buffering policy mandates to block the
    entire processing pipeline. This way, we can avoid
    losing logs (and notifications) when the Elasticsearch
    server is inaccessible for a long period of time.
    As a result, the StackLight collector has now two processes running
    on the node:

    * One for the *log_collector* service
    * One for the *metric_collector* service

  * Metrics derived from logs are aggregated by the *log_collector* service.

    To avoid flooding the *metric_collector* with bursts of metrics derived
    from logs, the *log_collector* service sends metrics by bulk to the
    *metric_collector* service.
    An example of aggregated metric derived from logs is the
    `openstack_<service>_http_response_time_stats
    <http://fuel-plugin-lma-collector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix_b.html#api-response-times>`_.

  * Diagnostic tool

    A diagnostic tool is now available to help diagnose problems.
    The diagnostic tool checks that the toolchain is properly installed
    and configured across the entire LMA toolchain. Please check the
    `Diagnostic Tool
    <http://fuel-plugin-lma-collector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#diagnostic>`_
    section of the User Guide for more information.
