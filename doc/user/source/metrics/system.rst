* ``disk_ops_write``, the number of write operations per second.
* ``disk_time_read``, the average time for a read operation to complete in the
  last interval.
* ``disk_time_write``, the average time for a write operation to complete in
  the last interval.

File system
^^^^^^^^^^^

Metrics have a ``fs`` field that contains the partition's mount point to which
the metric applies. For example, '/', '/var/lib', and others.

* ``fs_inodes_free``, the number of free inodes on the file system.

* ``fs_inodes_percent_used``, the percentage of used inodes.
* ``fs_inodes_reserved``, the number of reserved inodes.
* ``fs_inodes_used``, the number of used inodes.
* ``fs_space_free``, the number of free bytes.
* ``fs_space_percent_free``, the percentage of free bytes.
* ``fs_space_percent_reserved``, the percentage of reserved bytes.
* ``fs_space_percent_used``, the percentage of used bytes.
* ``fs_space_reserved``, the number of reserved bytes.
* ``fs_space_used``, the number of used bytes.

System load
^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``load_longterm``, the system load average over the last 15 minutes.
* ``load_midterm``, the system load average over the last 5 minutes.
* ``load_shortterm``, the system load average over the last minute.

Memory
^^^^^^

* ``memory_buffered``, the amount of buffered memory in bytes.
* ``memory_cached``, the amount of cached memory in bytes.
* ``memory_free``, the amount of free memory in bytes.
* ``memory_used``, the amount of used memory in bytes.

Network
^^^^^^^

Metrics have an ``interface`` field that contains the interface name the
metric applies to. For example, 'eth0', 'eth1', and others.

* ``if_errors_rx``, the number of errors per second detected when receiving
  from the interface.
* ``if_errors_tx``, the number of errors per second detected when transmitting
  from the interface.
* ``if_octets_rx``, the number of octets (bytes) received per second by the
  interface.
* ``if_octets_tx``, the number of octets (bytes) transmitted per second by the
  interface.
* ``if_packets_rx``, the number of packets received per second by the
  interface.
* ``if_packets_tx``, the number of packets transmitted per second by the
  interface.

Processes
^^^^^^^^^

* ``processes_count``, the number of processes in a given state. The metric has
  a ``state`` field (one of 'blocked', 'paging', 'running', 'sleeping',
  'stopped' or 'zombies').
* ``processes_fork_rate``, the number of processes forked per second.

Swap
^^^^

* ``swap_cached``, the amount of cached memory (in bytes) that is in the swap.

* ``swap_io_out``, the number of swap bytes read per second.
* ``swap_used``, the amount of used memory (in bytes) that is in the swap.

Users
^^^^^

* ``logged_users``, the number of users currently logged in.
