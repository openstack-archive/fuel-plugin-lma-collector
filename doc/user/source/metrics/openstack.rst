Service API checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _service_api_checks:

    the OpenStack service being checked.

  if it is responsive, if not, then ``0``. The metric contains a ``service``
  field that identifies ``<service>`` identifies the OpenStack service being
  checked.

``<service>`` is one of the following values with their respective resource
checks:
