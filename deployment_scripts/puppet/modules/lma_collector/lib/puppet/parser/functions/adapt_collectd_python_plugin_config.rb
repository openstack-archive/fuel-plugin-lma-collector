# This function is used by the lma_collector::collectd::python defined
# type to work-around a bug in collectd::plugin::python::module where
# the config hash cannot include values that are arrays or hashes.
# See https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-collectd/issues/390.
#
# Ex:
#
# ARG0:
#    {"key1" => ["e1", "e2"],
#     "key2" => {"k1" => "v1", "k2" => "v2"}
#     "key3" => "val3"}
#
# Result:
#     {"key1 \"e1\"" => "", "key1 \"e2\"" => "",
#      "key2 \"k1\"" => "\"v1\"", "key2 \"k2\"" => "\"v1\"",
#      "key3" => "\"val3\""}
#
