#
# == Class lma_collector::logs::swift
#
# Class that configures Heka for reading Swift logs.
#
# The following rsyslog pattern is assumed:
#
# <%PRI%>%TIMESTAMP% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg%\n
#
# Swift only uses syslog and doesn't add its logs to log files located in a
# /var/log/swift/ directory as other OpenStack services do. So we make Swift a
# special case and assume rsyslog is used.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*file_match*]
#   (mandatory) The log file name pattern. Example: 'swift\.log$'. Example
#   for a sequential rotating logfile: 'swift\.log\.?(?P<Seq>\d*)$'. See
#   http://hekad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pluginconfig/logstreamer.html
#   for more information.
#
# [*priority*]
#   (optional) When using sequential logstreams, the priority defines how
#   to sort the logfiles in order from the slowest to newest. Example:
#   '["^Seq"]'. See
#   http://hekad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pluginconfig/logstreamer.html
#   for more information.
#
# [*log_directory*]
#   (optional) The log directory. Default is /var/log.
#
