# == Define: lma_collector::logs::openstack
#
# Declaring this defined type creates an Heka logstreamer that reads logs of
# an OpenStack service. The logstreamer is automatically configured with an
# Heka decoder and an Heka splitter appropriate for OpenStack logs.
#
# It works for "standard" OpenStack services that write their logs into log files
# located in /var/log/{service}, where {service} is the service name.
#
define lma_collector::logs::openstack {

  # Note: $log_directory could be made configurable in the future.
