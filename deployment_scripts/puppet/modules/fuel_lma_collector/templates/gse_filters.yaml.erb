  # The GSE policies are applied to clusters and describe how the the GSE
  # cluster filter computes the cluster's status. The LMA toolchain is
  # pre-configured with a few set of policies but everything can be customized:
  # thresholds can be modified, new policies can be defined, and so on.
  #
  # A policy consists of a list of rules which are evaluated against the
  # current status of the cluster's members. When one of the rules matches, the
  # cluster's status gets the value associated with the rule and the evaluation
  # stops here. The last rule of the list is usually a catch-all rule that
  # defines the default status in case no other rule matched.
  #
  # The declaration of a policy rule is similar to an alarm rule except that:
  # - there are no 'metric', 'window' and 'period' parameters.
  # - there are only 2 supported functions:
  #   - 'count' which returns the number of members that match the passed value(s)
  #   - 'percent' which returns the percentage of members that match the passed value(s)
  #
  # The following rule definition reads as "the cluster's status is critical if
  # more than 50% of its members are either down or critical":
  #
  #    - status: critical
  #      trigger:
  #        logical_operator: or
  #        rules:
  #          - function: percent
  #            arguments: [ down, critical ]
  #            relational_operator: '>'
  #            threshold: 50
  #

    # A policy defining that the cluster's status depends on the member with the
    # highest severity, typically used for a cluster of services.
