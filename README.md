Logging, Monitoring and Alerting (LMA) Collector Plugin for Fuel
================================================================


Overview
--------

The Logging, Monitoring & Alerting (LMA) collector is a service running on each
OpenStack node that collects logs and notifications. Those data are sent to an
ElasticSearch server for diagnostic, troubleshooting and alerting purposes.

Installation Guide
==================


Prior to installing the LMA Collector Plugin, you may want to install
ElasticSearch and Kibana.
To install ElasticSearch and Kibana automatically using Fuel, you can refer to the
[ElasticSearch-Kibana Fuel Plugin
](https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-elasticsearch-kibana).

You can install ElasticSearch and Kibana outside of Fuel as long as
your installation meets the LMA Collector plugin's requirements defined above.

Exploring the data

Refer to the [ElasticSearch/Kibana
plugin](https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-elasticsearch-kibana) for
exploring and visualizing the collected data.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you see no data in the ElasticSearch server, check the following:

1. The LMA collector service is running
```
# On CentOS
/etc/init.d/lma_collector status
# On Ubuntu
status lma_collector
```
2. Look for errors in the LMA collector log file (located at
   `/var/log/lma_collector.log`) on the different nodes.
3. Nodes are able to connect to the ElasticSearch server on port 9200.
